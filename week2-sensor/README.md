# week 2 Sensor
## Assignment: A wind chime lamp for better sleeping

Please check [IR_withServo](https://github.com/nannz/cci-advanced-physical-computing/tree/main/week2-sensor/IR_withServo) as the final output.
I have tried PIR Motion Sensor, Tilt Sensor, and the IR transmitter and receiver.

The use of IR enables me to design the product helping sleep by making gentle sound with a wind chimes (powered by the motor).
At the beginning, there would be a ball hanging between the IR transmitter and the receiver, once the user picked the ball and put it down, the connection between IR transmitter and the receiver would be built, and thus causing the motor to drive the wind chime.
This is one of the series(four in total) that aims to build a sense of rituals before sleeping and make the full use of five senses(in this product it's the sense of hearing). Ultimately, a user will go to bed peacefully and enjoyably.
